For the provenance of Amazon9_lcc, mathoverflow-answers-all, and trivago-cities-all, look at the files in the folder 'data-processing-code'.

The hypergraph in 'tripadvisor.mat' is the same .mat file (with a different name) for the TripAdvisor dataset studied in the following paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11818

It is available on GitHub or Zenodo:

Zoo_H and Cities_H are two very small hypergraphs that just used as test cases for code snippets (see Section 7.1 in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09460.pdf).
